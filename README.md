# Groq Q/A Chatbot

This project is a user-friendly and interactive chatbot built using Streamlit, LangChain, Groq, and OpenAI APIs. The chatbot is designed to provide intelligent and accurate answers to user queries, leveraging cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs). Users can customize the chatbotâ€™s behavior using parameters like temperature and token limit, and they can choose from multiple advanced LLMs available.

# Features

#### User Authentication:
Enter your API key securely using the sidebar.

#### Model Selection:
Choose between multiple pre-trained LLMs for varied responses.

#### Adjustable Parameters:

+ **Temperature**: Control the creativity of responses.
+ **Max Tokens**: Set the maximum token limit for the response length.

#### Intelligent Prompts:
Uses a custom-designed system prompt for enhanced, human-like responses.

#### Interactive User Interface: 
Simple  and intuitive input/output fields using Streamlit.

# FAQ

#### 1. What if I encounter an API key error?
Ensure your `.env` file contains valid keys for both `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` and `GROQ_API_KEY`. Restart the application after updating the file.

#### 2. Can I add more models?
Yes, you can extend the dropdown options in the app.py file by integrating additional supported LLMs via LangChain or Groq APIs, Or you can use OpenAi, Ollama or HuggingFace.

#### 3. How do I modify the system prompt?
Update the `ChatPromptTemplate` section in `app.py` to customize the chatbot's behavior.

#### 4. How do I test the chatbot locally?
Follow the 'Run Locally' steps in the README. Use the command `streamlit run app.py` to launch the application, then enter queries into the user input field.

#### 5. What is the purpose of the temperature setting?
The `temperature` slider adjusts the randomness of the responses:

*Lower values* (e.g., 0.0): Responses will be deterministic and focused.
*Higher values* (e.g., 1.0): Responses will be more creative and diverse.

#### 6. What does Max Tokens control?
This slider sets the maximum length of the chatbot's response. Longer responses consume more tokens and may be slower.

#### 7. How do I ensure my API keys are secure?
+ Store keys in a .env file and avoid hardcoding them in the script.
+ Do not share your .env file publicly (e.g., on GitHub).
+ Use .gitignore to exclude .env from version control.

#### 8. Why am I getting a Rate Limit error?
Rate limits are imposed by the API provider. To resolve this:

+ Check your usage quota on the API providerâ€™s dashboard.
+ Upgrade your API plan if necessary.

#### 9. Can I integrate other APIs or frameworks?
Yes! You can extend the chatbot by integrating:

+ Other LLM providers (e.g., Hugging Face, OpenAI).
+ Vector databases for memory-based conversation.

#### 10. Is this chatbot multilingual?
The chatbot can respond in multiple languages depending on the capabilities of the selected model. Modify the system prompt to specify a target language if needed.

#### 11. How do I handle errors during runtime?
+ Invalid API Key: Double-check keys in the .env file.
+ Model Not Found: Ensure the selected model is supported by the API.
+ Timeout Errors: Increase the request timeout in the API settings.
